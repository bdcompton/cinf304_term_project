## Instructions to launch app
## Before cloning, ensure that local environment variables are set up for java and android

### 1. Clone repository
### 2. Create file local.properties and add line sdk.dir=(YOUR_PATH_TO_ANDROID_SDK)
### 3. Open up a terminal of your choice, change directory to /locationfinder/ and run:
```console
npm install
npm run android
```
### If done properly, the app should install and run on the emulator that is open. If errors occur after running the command, try running the second command a few more times consecutively as this will fix the error most of the time
